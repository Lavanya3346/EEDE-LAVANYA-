This repository contains solutions to four basic Java problems.  
Each problem demonstrates simple concepts of **Java programming** such as classes, loops, conditionals, collections, and string handling.  
All solutions are written in **Java** and include comments inside the code for better understanding.
# Java Problems – README

This project contains 4 simple Java programs with comments.

## Problem-1: Calculator (Class-based)
- Inputs: `a` (double), `b` (double), `operation` (String)
- Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Uses: Class, Methods, If/Switch

---

## Problem-2: Odd Series (1,3,5,... up to n terms)
- Input: integer `a`
- Output: Odd numbers till `a` terms
- Formula: `2*i - 1`

---

## Problem-3: Odd Series (Even/Odd Condition)
- Input: integer `a`
- If `a` is odd → series up to `a`
- If `a` is even → series up to previous odd
- Output matches given examples

---

## Problem-4: Count Multiples
- Input: List of integers
- Output: Count of multiples for numbers 1–9  
  Example: `{1=11, 2=8, 3=4, ... , 9=1}`
- Uses: HashMap, modulus `%`, loops

---

## Language
- **Java**  
- Concepts: Classes, Loops, If-Else, Switch, HashMap
